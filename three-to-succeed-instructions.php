    <p>The Fairfax County Youth Survey results indicate that when children and youth have <span class="bluetext">three or more positive, protective factors/assets</span> in their lives,
        they are more likely to manage stress, make better choices, and develop healthy habits.</p>
    <p>The graphs on this page show how <span class="bluetext">students' behaviors vary in relation to their number of assets</span>.
        For example, select the "Alcohol" category to see how the percentage of students that use alcohol changes based on their number of assets.</p>
